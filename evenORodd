''' Ask the user for a number.
Depending on whether the number is even or odd,
print out an appropriate message to the user.

Hint: how does an even / odd number react
differently when divided by 2?

Extras:

If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.

Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num)
and one number to divide by (check).

If check divides evenly
into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different
appropriate message.
'''

num = input('pick a number: ')
check = input('pick another number!: ')

num = int(num)
check = int(check)

rem = num % check

if (rem == 0):
    print(str(check) + ' divides evenly into ' + str(num))
else:
    print(str(check) + ' does NOT divide evenly into ' + str(num))
